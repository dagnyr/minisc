# 🧫 minisc

### About
A simple all-in-one package for single cell analysis in Julia. It provides clear and simple building blocks for standard steps in single cell analysis, such as loading data, normalizing or scaling, pca, clustering, and plotting.

### Current Functions or In-Progress
* Loading Data (in-progress)
* Normalizing, Log Transforming, and Scaling (in-progress)
* Finding variable genes
* Deviance Residuals for Normalization
* PCA (in-progress)

### Future Functions
* Clustering
* UMAP
* Differential gene expression analysis
* Plotting (UMAPs, dot-plots, heatmaps, violin plots, etc.)
* Pseudo-bulking
* Doublet detection
* Harmony / SCTransform implementation using RCall.jl

### How do I use minisc?
It is currently a work in progress, check for updates and a vignette/tutorial in the future.

### Can you fix X issue or add X function/utility?
Please add an issue or reach out directly if you have any ideas or have any issues - I want minisc to be as functional as possible!
