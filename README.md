### About
A simple all-in-one package for single cell analysis in Julia. It provides clear and simple building blocks for standard steps in single cell analysis, such as loading data, normalizing or scaling, pca, clustering, and plotting.

### In-Progress
* Loading Data (in-progress)
* Normalizing, Log Transforming, and Scaling (in-progress)
* Finding variable genes
* Deviance Residuals for Normalization
* PCA (in-progress)
* Clustering
* UMAP
* Differential gene expression analysis
* Plotting (UMAPs, dot-plots, heatmaps, violin plots, etc.)
* Pseudo-bulking
* Doublet detection
* Harmony / SCTransform implementation using RCall.jl
